# LoopWorkspace

[![Build Loop](https://github.com/hfeiss/LoopWorkspace/actions/workflows/build_loop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hfeiss/LoopWorkspace/actions/workflows/build_loop.yml)

This iOS app is built using cloud-based GitHub workflows. The Loop app is automatially pushed to TestFlight for distribution and use. For more information, see [LoopDocs: Browser Build](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-overview/).

If you know me personally, don't hesitate to reach out with any questions about closed loop insulin delivery.
